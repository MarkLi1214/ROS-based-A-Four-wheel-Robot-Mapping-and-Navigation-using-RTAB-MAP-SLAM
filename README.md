# ROS-based-A-Four-wheel-Robot-Mapping-and-Navigation-using-RTAB-MAP-SLAM
The presented work describes an implementation of A Four-wheels Robot Mapping and
Navigation in the laboratory using RTABMAP SLAM based on the ROS platform. It
explains in detail how to configure the packages required for the experiment and how to
configure the files required for mapping and navigation and a discussion is drawn relating
practical aspects of the algorithms with the inner workings and main parameters of the
respective ROS implementation
